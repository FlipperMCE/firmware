Request:  0x8B 20 aa aa aa aa bb bb
Response: 0xXX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX

a: Block number in big endian, 512-byte units
b: Number of blocks in big endian

Raises a EXI interrupt when ready to read first block.
Upon first EXI interrupt, storage access is locked to the host system for the number of blocks.
If only one block is requested, READ_SINGLE_BLOCK should be used.

a: Block number in big endian, 512-byte units
b: Number of blocks in big endian

Raises a EXI interrupt when ready to write first block, if in exclusive read/write mode.
Upon first EXI interrupt, storage access is locked to the host system for the number of blocks.
If only one block is requested, WRITE_SINGLE_BLOCK should be used. SET_WR_BLK_ERASE_COUNT should be used with WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK.


Command:  Write block
Request:  0x8B 23 aa ...
